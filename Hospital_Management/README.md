# Hospital Management Data Model

---

This repository contains a comprehensive **data model** and schema designs tailored for a hospital management system. It provides clear insights into structuring patient records, appointments, staff details, medical procedures, and other essential hospital data for robust and efficient operations.

---

## üöÄ What's Inside

This repository is designed to serve as a foundational blueprint for developing or understanding the data architecture of a hospital management system. You'll find:

* **Core Entities**: Detailed schemas for key hospital components, including:
    * `Patients`: Patient demographics, medical history, contact information.
    * `Doctors`: Doctor profiles, specializations, schedules.
    * `Staff`: Administrative staff, nurses, technicians, and their roles.
    * `Appointments`: Scheduling, patient-doctor linkages, status.
    * `MedicalRecords`: Diagnoses, treatments, medications, test results.
    * `Departments`: Hospital departments and their structure.
    * `Rooms/Beds`: Room and bed allocation management.
    * `Billing`: Services rendered, charges, payment status.
* **Relational Design**: The model primarily focuses on a relational database approach, leveraging relationships for data integrity and efficient querying.
* **Key Relationships**: Clearly defined relationships between entities (e.g., a patient has many appointments, a doctor belongs to a department).
* **Design Principles**: Adherence to principles like normalization to minimize redundancy and improve data consistency.
* **SQL Scripts & ORM Definitions (Planned/Coming Soon)**: DDL scripts for creating tables and potentially ORM definitions in a future update.

## üìä Visual Models

Explore the conceptual and logical design of this hospital management data model visually through the [Eraser.io workspace](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/m2XB8fNuNn9z6lk696RC?origin=share). This diagram provides a clear overview of the entities and their relationships.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

While the focus is on the data model itself, the design principles are generally applicable and can be implemented using:

* **Relational Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc.
* **Modeling Tools**: Eraser.io (for diagrams), various ERD tools.
* **Conceptual Languages**: SQL DDL.

## üí° How to Use This Repository

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/devStormAkash/Hospital-Management-Data-Model.git](https://github.com/devStormAkash/Hospital-Management-Data-Model.git)
    cd Hospital-Management-Data-Model
    ```
    (Please note: You might need to adjust `https://github.com/devStormAkash/Hospital-Management-Data-Model.git` to your actual repository URL once created).
2.  **Study the Schema**: Examine the data model definitions (e.g., `.sql` or conceptual files) to understand the entities, attributes, and relationships.
3.  **Review Visuals**: Utilize the Eraser.io link to get a quick visual grasp of the entire system's data flow.
4.  **Adapt & Implement**: Use this model as a reference or a starting point for building your own hospital management system database.
