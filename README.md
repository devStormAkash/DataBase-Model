# Data Models Collection

---

This repository is a structured collection of various **data models**, each organized within its own dedicated folder. Inside these folders, you'll find **JavaScript files** defining the specific data structures and relationships, offering practical examples for different application needs.

## üöÄ What's Inside

This repository is designed to be a clear and accessible resource for understanding diverse data modeling approaches. You'll find:

* **Organized Data Models**: Each top-level folder represents a distinct data model or a group of related models (e.g., `UserProfiles`, `ProductCatalog`, `AnalyticsData`).
* **JavaScript Definitions**: Within each data model's folder, the core of the model is defined using JavaScript files. These files typically outline:
    * **Schema Definitions**: The fields, data types, and constraints for data entities.
    * **Relationships**: How different entities connect to each other.
    * **Example Data**: Sometimes, you might find sample data to illustrate the model's structure.
* **Diverse Use Cases**: Models covering a range of applications, from e-commerce to social media, content management, and more.
* **Focus on Clarity**: The models are designed to be easily understandable, emphasizing clean structure and logical relationships.
