# Basic Commercial Website Data Model

---

This repository provides a foundational **data model** and schema designs for a basic commercial or e-commerce website. It outlines the essential data structures for managing users, products, orders, categories, and other core components, offering a clear blueprint for building robust online platforms.

## üöÄ What's Inside

This repository is designed to be a practical starting point for anyone building or understanding the data architecture of a commercial website. You'll find:

* **Core Entities**: Detailed schemas for fundamental commercial website components, including:
    * `Users`: Customer information, login details, addresses.
    * `Products`: Product details, descriptions, pricing, inventory.
    * `Categories`: Product categorization for Browse.
    * `Orders`: Order details, status, payment information.
    * `OrderItems`: Linking products to specific orders (many-to-many relationship).
    * `Carts`: Shopping cart functionality for users.
    * `Reviews`: User-generated product reviews and ratings.
* **Relational Design**: The model primarily focuses on a relational database approach, optimizing for data integrity, relationships, and efficient querying.
* **Key Relationships**: Clearly defined relationships between entities (e.g., a user places many orders, a product belongs to a category).
* **Design Principles**: Adherence to principles like normalization to minimize redundancy and ensure data consistency.
* **SQL Scripts & ORM Definitions (Planned/Coming Soon)**: DDL scripts for creating tables and potentially ORM definitions in a future update.

## üìä Visual Models

Explore the conceptual and logical design of this basic commercial website data model visually through the [Eraser.io workspace](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/XGv5RVoX37x8tEH98jJ3?origin=share). This diagram offers a clear overview of the entities, their attributes, and interrelationships.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

While the focus is on the abstract data model, the design principles are broadly applicable and can be implemented using:

* **Relational Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, etc.
* **Modeling Tools**: Eraser.io (for diagrams), various ERD tools.
* **Conceptual Languages**: SQL DDL.

## üí° How to Use This Repository

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/devStormAkash/Basic-Commercial-Website-Data-Model.git](https://github.com/devStormAkash/Basic-Commercial-Website-Data-Model.git)
    cd Basic-Commercial-Website-Data-Model
    ```
    (Please note: You might need to adjust `https://github.com/devStormAkash/Basic-Commercial-Website-Data-Model.git` to your actual repository URL once created).
2.  **Study the Schema**: Examine the data model definitions (e.g., `.sql` or conceptual files) to understand the entities, attributes, and relationships.
3.  **Review Visuals**: Utilize the Eraser.io link to get a quick visual grasp of the entire system's data flow.
4.  **Adapt & Implement**: Use this model as a reference or a starting point for building the database for your own commercial website.
